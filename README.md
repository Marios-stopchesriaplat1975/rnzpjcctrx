Just left Demon City and wow, my brain feels like it's been through a blender... serously. The theater was jam-packed, and the guy behind me kept coughing like he was auditioning for a plague  . My back is killing me from those ancient seats, but damn, those visuals just... I mean, what was that first scene with the neon-lit rooftops? Like Blade Runner met a fever dream, but with... with more neon? Just insane. My popcorn's all over my lap, but who cares when you’re lost in a city that breathes like it's alive.

Magic and mayhem and that sound... the soundtrack’s still ringing in my ears like an electric storm. That score — electro fused with some witchy chants — made my insides vibrate like a cat on a radiator. Speaking of cats, why was that cat glowing? Was it symbolic? I’m not sure. I was too distracted by the girl with the eyes, the one who could probably see through my lies... maybe yours too. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you want to your head to spin. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to, I don’t know, pause on those insane monster designs?

> So much smoke everywhere, like a 90s nightclub, you’d think the director had a fog machine addiction. Then there was that chase scene where the city twisted like a Rubik’s Cube. Can’t tell if it was CGI or some underground magician they hired. Felt like my eyes were playing Twister with my brain.

Someone next to me was snoring, I think? Or was that sound coming from the  ? Who even knows. Demon City doesn’t stop to explain, just drags you along by the collar and dumps you in a realm that chews logic and spits out confusion, but I...guess that's the point? Never saw a more chaotic parade of hauntingly jacked-up images, seriously, reminded me of the nightmares that taste like old caramel — sticky and impossible to shake off. Need a beer to digest all that.

And the ending, oh boy, what was that spiral of chaos with the hero turning into... was that a tree? Or a metaphor? What even is a metaphor at this point? But that’s Demon City for you, where answers are just questions having a bad hair day.
